## Introduction

On Dayu's [blog][1], I saw an article introducing the main software of the year, which comes from a [GitHub project][2]. The project initiator will aggregate the article links and RSS feeds into an OPML file for easy subscription.

I also have similar thoughts in my outdated DigitalGarden, which is called the useful tools discovered in 2023.It can be merged, taking the opportunity to participate in the project.
